# DNSAdmin Group AD Abuse
## Create Custom DLL with Reverse Shell in new thread

DLL Created using MSFVENOM crashes the DNS service after it restarts because it does not fork as a separate process for the elevated shell.
Thatâ€™s not a good thing during a pentest since it will distrupt DNS requests in an organisation. To get around this, we can add a function in the DLL that starts an elevated shell in a new thread and keeps the DNS service running.
